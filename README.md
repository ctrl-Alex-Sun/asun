# asun = A Sun in the Sky = Alex Sun, yk?

Full of confidence as always

## Stuff I need to do for this website

1.  Read nextjs.org documentation
2.  Add what I've done (I doubt you care about Adam II lol)
3.  Go look at some other people's personal sites and steal their good ideas

Congratulations! You should have a URL like:

```bash
https://ctrl-alex-sun.github.io/asun/
```

For more information, see our [deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports).
