## Why you should hire me

1.  Willing to do anything for that paycheck
2.  Recognize that *I* don't matter, I'm just a corporate slave
3.  On GitHub, go to **Settings** > **Pages** > **Source**, and choose **GitHub Actions** as the source
4.  Make a commit and push it to see the changes on GitHub Pages

Congratulations! You should have a URL like:

```bash
